                DOM, have distracting CSS formatting in-line styled, have scattered
                designs, and may lack a sense of purpose. Long personal blog sites made from
                scratch without direction may tend towards this.

            <td><p>Average sites are those that fulfill the basic needs of any decent site:
                their HTML is mostly semantic, leaving aesthetics to CSS, and said 
                aesthetics are not distracting or wrongly done, though perhaps plain and
                ascetic. Pages have a structure and flow, and things are where they logically
                should be: navigation is likely at the side or top, pictures perhaps take up
                limited space, etc. A plain but well-designed scratch site may fall into this
                category.

            <td><p>Great</p></td>
            <td><p>Great sites are those designed with purpose and research. UX is studied and
                implemented throughout the site, with obvious attention to where the user is 
                directed and how they flow through the site. Attention is made to being mindful
                of space and resources, such that pages do not take too long to load and the user
                is not overwhelmed (and, coincidentally, the SEO ranking may go up). There may
                be some visual flourishes, but only in aid of the user's and/or site's goal (for
                instance, a submit button may be highlighted or stand-out from the clear to avoid issues).
                Alternatively, great sites can be classified as those who fulfill their purpose in
                another manner. For example, a portfolio or artistic site that maximizes on visual
                effects of awesome, even at the expense of speed and loading.

                a website or have extremely fine-tuned and excellent design. Such sites must be near flawless or
                have extraordinary capability in fulfilling their purpose: a portfolio that masterfully
                shows off the designers potential or a simple but effective and streamlined shopping site.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        First, I learned that HTML is somewhat dumb and inconsistent. Some form elements
        are handled by input type="", whereas others are handled with their
        own elements (e.g. select), which seems counter-intuitive to a streamlined
        standard. Secondly, I learned the differences bewteen GET and POST.
        Originally each had their own seperate uses which one can probably 
        derive from their names. However, both can be used in relatively 
        similar capacities of passing data from a user now. POST, overall, seems
        to be the superior method in many cases due to its lack of length limit, 
        ability to be secured and encrypted, etc. GET, however, does serve some use,
        and notably boasts the ability to have a URL that can display
        the same results to multiple users (whereas POST does not share its
        data in links and thus requires more handiwork to replicate results). Regarding styling,
        I simply linked my stylesheet from previous projects that normalized the styling.
        I already had a table styling on my "Examples" page, hence not too much extra work was needed.
        The CSS alternates childs to apply a slightly different opacity/background-color to give
        each row distinction, as well as a on-hover effect to give some "pop". Ideally,
        the rubric and examples page will join forces, with the form submitting data to a server
        and the page being generated by that server, which is completely do-able, except I dont
        have an active server -- an alternative would thus be Javascript loading a local text
        file an using it for persistent memory, something worth considering in the future.
