        <h3>Activity Feed</h3>
        <p>
            The feed given on the homepage. It is structured wtih HTML to create
            neat section blocks, each with their own abilities. CSS is responsible for
            the satisfying on hover effects, such as changing the color of the buttons to
            indicate you are about to click it. The interesting stuff, though, is the backend.
            Likely, PHP is used to generate each of these comment sections using a template and grabbing the
            data from a RDBMS such as MySQL (or an equivalent) using SQL (or an equivalent). These
            posts could be generated per user based on their communities -- the server can identify the user
            perhaps based on front-end Javascript sending to the server via POST the credentials of the user.
            Additional functionality is alsoprovided, most likely, by client-side JS, such as
            the "show more" button. Additionally, content is not loaded all at once, but
            rather some of it is loaded as the user scrolls, likely client-side JS making
            specialized calls back to server and requesting new content which it then appends
            to the body.

        <h3>Responsive Web Design: Nav and Message Button</h3>
        <p>
            The page changes quite a bit at a certain threshold, allowing mobile users to not be crushed with
            content while desktop users have all of their tools availiable. One example of this is the navbar. When
            below the threshold (mobile/tablet view), the fixed head at the top consolidates into 3 objects from 9, with
            one of those objects being an easily recognizable triple-line menu bar icon. The responsiveness of the page
            is a result of several factors, but likely primarily from (1) Good, structured HTML, (2) Proper use of
            CSS and media-queries, (3) a bit of Javascript. Regarding actually changing the page's layout, this is usually done
            in CSS witha  media-query, which looks at the device's width and height and changes the CSS based on this. This carries a lot
            of the weight of changing from mobile to web or vice versa, instead of relying on seperate pages or a lot Javascript to rearrange
            elements. Server-side should play almost no role here -- Indeed, turn off your wifi connection and you should still be
            able to see the page change shape. The content and structure remains the same, only the aesthetics and manner 
            in which the user interacts with it adjusts (and this is already in the files, thus does not need to be pulled
            from the server, instead just switching as needed). An element which may involve a bit more JS and code-logic are such things
            as the quick message feature -- in the mobile version, the message button under the menu takes the user to another page, but in
            the desktop version, it opens a mini-frame to do quick messaging tasks without switching the page. This also represents, most
            likely, a mobile-first deisgn pattern: features were added as they expanded from the mobile design to the  PC design
            to allow PC users greater options, instead of, say, the quick-message feature being implemented and then crammed into 
            the mobile version somehow.
