            Kinetic is a web-application company that specializes in modern
            approaches to websites. From the UI and UX to the back-end PHP,
            they handle it all. Their site itself is nice, although some of
            their works are better in my oppinion. They are also working on
            adding accessibility to their sites, including this one (which
            my friend Gabriel is actually doing).

            This is an example of the extreme UI that one can go for, and one
            of my favorite examples of what is possible with development tools.
            A pure work of art, the page has the fluidity of an organism and 
            on its own justifies the author's everpresent egoism. While this, of course,
            would not be a great design for a commerce site or blog or such, it works
            great at being a portfolio -- the load time matters less due to the audience
            being targeted individuals, and the examples all have a pseudo-structure
            to them that brings everything together much unlike this paragraph.

            While a mediocre site on its own (well, actually not too bad), this
            page has several examples of parrallax sites. While parallax does not
            by itself make a great site and can be distracting in the wrong area,
            most of these examples utilize good web-design techniques that create
            artistic and gorgeous sites. Though some suffer their usability or UX
            from this as well as their adaptability, for the most part these 
            are great sites to derive inspiration and observe the potential of
            good site design.

            Amazon, the premiere eCommerce site of the day, utilizes several
            UI and UZ techniques to engage the user and create a user interaction
            not unlike window-shopping a store street. It also utilizes a 
            responsive web design to make-way for the large range of devices that
            may utilize its services.

            TV Tropes is essentially an informal wiki focused primarily on
            media tropes from videogames, movies, animes, literature, etc.
            TV Tropes uses a similar design and standard for most of its pages,
            serving as a great example of a community-driven wiki. You can always
            expect the image to be in one place, the page quote at the top, etc.
            It is also responsive, maintaing different forms on mobile and desktop
