            <h2>Creating a Foundation...</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">Decribe how you built the site and accomplished the requirements.</p>

            Any endeavor that hopes to even mildly succeed needs a strong foundation first. In web development,
            we call that foundation HTML. HW1 focused on establishing a strong HTML grounding. While HTML can, at
            the surface level, be easily added and edited to format text and images, it is best thought about in 
            a semantic manner. HTML elements should have purpose and represent a meaningful structure to both 
            humans and machines. As such, even when initially creating the HTML with no CSS, I created the HTML with
            structure and flow in mind as opposed to styling and events -- these aspects of webpages should be left
            exclusively to CSS and JS. 
            Regarding the requirements, I created the files stated in the outline and gave them a brief structure
            or at least mentally thought out their relative structure and then filled them in as needed.
            Read more below on how I accomplished various requirements specifically.

            <h2>CSS and JS: Adding Dynamacy</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">Decribe how you changed the style of the page through CSS/JS.</p>
            <date></date>
        </header><p>
            Due to creating the HTML with semantic purpose in-mind only and without regard to styling, the CSS is
            easily modifiable and malleable. Any changes in the site aesthetic can, for the most part, be solved
            entirely within the normalize.css file (if the project gros it may be necessary to seperate into more
            focused CSS files, but for now one large file will suffice). Changing the page's themes and colors is
            as simple as editing a few lines in said CSS file. 
            In regards to the assignment on creating an alternate CSS file and page, I accomplished this in two manners.
            One is the traditional, stated way: There is an "indexAlt.html" and "normalizeAlt.css" page, which are 
            approximate clones of the index and normalize pages, though with some styling differences. Again, these
            aesthetic differences are changed entirely with CSS. In my second approach, I used a tiny bit of Javascript
            and JQuery to toggle CSS classes on and off elements. The elements have a default style via CSS, and the same
            CSS file also handles additional classes that may exist should the "Theme" button be pressed. These other classes
            are appended by the JS to the elements, thus superceding the default appearances and classes (when they have
            the same specificty that is). Note that the JS only applies classes and does not directly change the CSS, and for
            good reason: while possible, changing the CSS directly with JS affects the element.style in the HTML proper, hence
            it will ALWAYS have a greater specificty than anything in the normalize.css, unless the !important modifier is used (which
            is typically not a good habit to make as it reduces flexibility of the CSS). While this does not come up in most cases, 
            there are some instances where this is undesirable: for instance, if I want the link color to change on hover in the
            CSS file, if the JS sets the color of a tags, then a:hover will be overwritten due to lower specificty.
            Anyhwo, along with a transition attribute in some CSS styles, the page switches themes easily. Additionally,
            it's relatovely easy to manage, as all aesthetic changes to those elements (whether the default or alternate value) 
            are easily made in the CSS file alone (though adding the theme change to other elements requires an extra line
            in JS).

            <h3>audio</h3>
            <p>
                The audio tag, like the video tag, can be used to expectedly play a certain sound effect or music.
                However, be careful with this: loud, obnoxious sounds can be annoying for all users, and most users
                do not expect nor necessarily want your choice of songs playing when they are a few clicks away from their
                own favorite music. Ask yourself: is this necessary? Will my users want this? Like ads or unnecessary videos,
                excess media can drag out page load times, slow down the site, and be undesriable.

            <h3>picture</h3>
            <p>
                The picture tag, for lack of a better expression, is similar to an upgraded img tag. It is capable
                of storing multiple images, and thus sees use in responsive sites (to cycle through images based on
                screen size) as well as site pciture slideshow scenarios. THe img tag is still usable, though, and even
                used within the picture tag, acting as the default should a browser (ER HEM INTERNET EXPLORE COUGH COUGH)
                not fully support the picture tag.

            <h3>meter</h3>
            <p>
                The meter is a nice bar to show ratios and quantity. Think about YouTube's like-to-dislike ratio
                meter that gives at a quick glance the general quality of video (according to the internet that is).
                I have also seen this used in FBS systems, such as Priority Software, in various places: show how many
                shops are active, how many hours you are allotted out of the day, etc. It can be used to take a few, perhaps
                unwieldy numbers and display them in a quick and user-friendly manner.
