        <li>Age: 20</li>
        <li>Birthdate: June 22nd, 1999</li>

        <li>Weight: 145 lbs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Elijah T.he Rose is an aspiring Electrical Engineer, focusing on software 
        development. He currently attends UAB, where he does cool stuff like writing
        autobiographical HTML pages and being meta in a vain attempt at humor.</p>

    <h2>Childhood</h2>
    <p>
        Elijah's childhood was hard and troublesome, except not really. While there
        was no silver spoon, he grew up in a loving and caring home with great role 
        models, namely his many parents.  His father, George, was a natural-born leader
        and DIY guy who excelled at managing restaurants and factories. His mother, Amy,
        was an artist with a lot of creativity and very caring heart, teaching him to find
        the joys of simpler aspects of life. His other mother, Jessica, similarly taught him
        humility and patience in dealing with people (although how much he actually absorbed
        from these lesson is another matter). <br/>
        Elijah Rose generally did well in school, although not necessarily exceptional either,
        and found a fondness for math and the sciences -- the rigidity of its logic and axioms
        complimented his love of rules and order, while still maintaining a beautiful
        pseudo creativity of its own. During his Highschool years, he joined an International
        Baccalaureate school to further investigate calculus and physics. He submitted an
        Extended Essay on the effect of temperature on the creation of ferromagnets, although
        unfortunately it did not turn out terribly significant results due to poor funding (re:
        using house-hold materials only). Nevertheless, IB solidified that he enjoyed these STEM
        fields.

    <h2>Future Aspirations</h2>
    <p>
        While Elijah is not a great programmer yet, he hopes to develop amazing 
        software "in the future". While he knows he loves coding and software, he does
        not know what sub-field he currently wishes to specialize in -- web app 
        development, video-game logic, practical AI, database management, and networking
        are but a few of the many possibilities to explore. Elijah is also interested,
        although lesser so, in robotics and 3D modelling; he hopes to incorporate those
        interests into his future career.
    </p>
    <h2>Interests/Fun Stuff</h2>
    <p>
        Elijah isn't all about boring code stuff though, and in his free time he likes
        to code scripts in Unity! That is, he likes to modify files to enhance his gaming
        experience, especially in Virtual Reality (VR). For instance, he made a cross-loli
        knight and added animations and sound effects to trigger on certain inputs of the 
        controllers, allowing F U L L I M M E R S I O N as a loli knight in VR Chat.<br/>
        Rose also enjoys cute things -- sugar gliders, cats, dogs, bows, lolis, etc. which
        some find creepy but he doesn't care because cute things are awesome. And cute. 
        Alongside this he also takes a fancy to anime and videogames, playing anything from
        action-packed medieval fighting games (<a href="https://mordhau.com/">Mordhau</a>, 
        and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Honor">For Honor</a>)
        to thoughtful logistical problem-solving games (<a href="https://factorio.com/">Factorio</a>,
        and <a href="https://www.satisfactorygame.com/">Satisfactory</a>). Elijah also typically
        enjoys spending time with his family and friends, although he needs his isolation time
        to recharge from social encounters. Most of all, though, Elijah loves being a servant of
        Jesus Christ, or at least attempting to do so, and spreading the name of Jesus through worship
        and praise.
    </p>
    <p>
        In conclusion, you can tell that Elijah is an average, normal, and very very boring
        boi with no real defining or special characteristics at all that sets him apart from
        the hordes of other lucky-go-happy young adult males in America. huzzah... :(
